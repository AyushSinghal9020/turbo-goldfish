 The Contractor shall be required to purchase the Mandatory Pro tected Quantity of the concreting 
materials as specified in the Form of Tender from the Employer.  
 
 The Contractor shall indicate the Additional Protected Quantit y of the above materials to be purchased 
from the Employer in the Form of Tender, subject to the Maximum  Protected Quantity specified therein. 
The quantities indicated shall exclude: 
 
(a) the Mandatory Protected Quantity; and 
(b) the quantities required for Contractor’s source of precast comp onents supplied from overseas as 
the Employer only supply materials to sites within Singapore. 
  The Contractor shall place his orders directly with the Employ er and comply strictly with the "Conditions 
For The Supply Of Materials From The Employer" as stipulated in  Appendix A13.  The Contractor shall 
be deemed to have included all costs and expenses to be incurre d by him in compliance with the 
requirements stipulated in this clause in the Contract Sum. 
 
 The SO Rep reserves the right to allocate the monthly quantity  to the Contractor as well as to nominate 
the Employer’s supplier.  The Contractor shall absorb the total  quantity allocated to him.  If the 
Contractor's requirement is more than the Employer's capacity t o supply, the SO Rep may direct the 
Contractor to supplement his requirement from other sources.  I n this event, the Contractor shall bear 
any additional cost and expense so incurred. 
 
 
1.2.12.3 Quantity To be Protected 
 
 The Contractor shall be notified of the quantity to be covered  under the provision of this clause 
(hereinafter referred to as the "Approved Protected Quantity") within one (1) month from the date of the 
Letter of Acceptance. 
 
 The Contractor shall be invoiced for the Approved Protected Qu antity at the Basic Price.  The HDB 
posted prices of the Protected Materials at any time shall be d eemed to be those in the HDB's Monthly 
Price Lists which are also available for viewing at the Procure ment Office, Basement 1 HDB Hub. 
 
 The Contractor is deemed to have based his Tender on the poste d price for the Protected Materials 
and Protected Quantity, at the date Fourteen (14) days before t he closing date of the Tender (hereinafter 
referred to as the "Basic Price"), for the Protected Materials.   To illustrate: if a Tender closes on the 
14th day of a particular month, the Contractor is deemed to hav e based his Tender on the posted price 
prevailing on the last day of the preceding month.

1.2.12.3 Quantity To be Protected    (Cont’d) 
  In the event of the Contractor failing to obtain the Approved Protected Quantity in full throughout the 
Time for Completion and any time during which liquidated damage s are imposed under the Contract, a 
shortfall recovery shall be effected using the following formul a: 
   Amount of Shortfall Recovery = P
B x (Q P - Q A) 
 
    w h e r e :  P B =  B a s i c  P r i c e ;  
      Q P = Approved Protected Quantity; 
      Q A = Actual quantity purchased under this clause. 
 
 In a situation where the Employer is not able to supply in ful l the Approved Protected Quantity and the 
SO Rep has directed the Contractor to supplement his requiremen t from other sources, such purchases 
shall not be covered by the provisions under this clause.  Howe ver, for the purpose of ascertaining for 
shortfall quantity, the quantity purchased from the Contractor' s own source shall be included in Q A when 
determining whether the Contractor has obtained in full the App roved Protected Quantity. 
 
 For this purpose, the Contractor shall be required to maintain  proper documentary evidence of the 
delivery of each of the materials and such evidence shall be du ly endorsed by the SO Rep. 
  In a situation where the Contractor’s local production of prec ast concrete components are subsequently 
carried out in overseas precast plants or where a change in the  design of the Works or where the use 
of crushed granite fines pursuant to clause 4.2.1 of the Specif ications results in substantial changes to 
the quantity of concreting materials required, upon request by the Contractor with sufficient 
substantiation and verified by the SO Rep, the Approved Protect ed Quantity may be reviewed and 
adjusted subject to approval by the Employer.  The Approved Pro tected Quantity shall be adjusted by 
applying the percentage of additional protected quantity opted by the Contractor (hereinafter referred 
to as the “Percentage of Protection Coverage”) on the requested  quantum as illustrated below. 
  To illustrate:   Assume the Mandatory Protected Quantity is 14,000 tonnes.  Ove r and above the Mandatory Protected 
Quantity, the Contractor had opted for Additional Protected Qua ntity of 8,000 tonnes, which is 20% of 
the Maximum Protected Quantity (i.e. 8,000 tonnes / 40,000 tonn es). This 20% is the Percentage of 
Protection Coverage opted by the Contractor

Percentage of Protection 
Coverage (%)   [20%]  
 
 The Contractor subsequently requested for revision to the Appr oved Protected Quantity due to some 
precast elements amounting to 4,000 tonnes of cement that were shifted to overseas production and 
approved by the Employer.  The revision to the Approved Protect ed Quantity would be as follows: 
 
Cement required for Precast Elements 
Produced Overseas =  4,000 tonnes 
Percentage of Protection Coverage =  20%  
    (8,000 tonnes / 40,000 tonnes) 
Pro-rated Allowable Revision to 
Approved Protected Quantity =  20% x 4,000 tonnes 
 
=  800 tonnes 
    (to be reduced from Additional     
    Protected Quantity) 
 Revised Approved Protected Quantity =  21,200 tonnes 
    (ie. 14,000 tonnes + 7,200 tonnes)

(DPG) 2.16 PENETRATION AND SIZE OF PILES  
 
 The Contractor shall be required to install any size of the pi les as shown in the specifications or drawings 
and each pile in the position indicated on the drawings to the required depth.  
 
 The onus of obtaining the required resistance to withstand the  required test load within the limit of 
settlement shall rest with the Contractor but the piles shall n ot be installed unnecessarily beyond the 
depth for them to develop the required test load. Should Contra ctor find that a longer penetration is 
required due to poor ground conditions being encountered as wor k proceeds, this will be permitted only 
if it is proved to be justified by examination and tests of the  soils in the boreholes. The Contractor must 
also state sound and acceptable basis for determining the penet ration required.  
 
 If ground conditions indicate that the sizes of any subsequent  piles as proposed and shown on the 
drawings are inadequate then the Contractor shall produce suffi cient evidence to prove that a larger 
diameter would be more suitable. Conversely, where a pile is to  be constructed in very good ground, 
the Contractor must produce sufficient evidence to show that th e reduced length of pile will be capable 
of carrying the specified load. However, the Contractor must fi rst obtain the approval of the SO Rep if 
longer or shorter penetration is required. 
  
2.17 TOLERANCE FROM TRUE POSITION  
 
 The centre of each pile at the cut-off level shall not deviate  f r o m  i t s  t r u e  p o s i t i o n  a s  s h ow n  i n  t h e 
drawings by more than 75 mm in any direction. Should the deviat ion be more than the stated tolerance 
in any direction, the affected pile is liable to be rejected an d compensating piles shall be installed at 
Contractor's own expense when directed by the SO Rep.  
   
 All additional cost of amendment in pile cap, beams, etc desig ned as a counter measure to the pile 
eccentricities exceeding the permissible tolerance shall also b e borne by the Contractor.  
 
 
2.18 DAMAGED AND REJECTED PILES  
  Damaged piles and piles installed out of position or twisted s hall be rejected and/or removed and 
replacement pile(s) shall be substituted by the Contractor at h is own expense even if piles of bigger 
capacity are required.  
  Piles shall be installed truly vertical and any pile with an i nclination exceeding 1 (horizontal) to 75 
(vertical) is liable to be rejected and shall be similarly remo ved and replaced when ordered by the SO 
Rep at Contractor's own expense.  
 
 In addition, the Contractor shall also bear the extra cost as a result of rejection and replacement or 
supplemented by additional pile(s) due to an increase in size o f pile caps, strengthening of the ground 
beam, etc.  
 
 Piles which have risen or are disturbed as a result of install ing adjacent piles shall be reinstated to the 
original depth and resistance. Otherwise, it shall be replaced by compensating piles at the Contractor's 
expense.  
 
 
2.19 PILE VERTICALITY MEASUREMENT  
 
 The Contractor shall provide all necessary equipments to facil itate the measurement of the verticality 
of the piles.  All such equipments shall be pre-approved by the  SO Rep.

(DPG) 2.20 LOAD TESTS  
 
 (a)  Working Load Test (WLT) 
 
  The Contractor shall include in the Contract Sum the number o f WLT as specified by the SO Rep 
for the whole Contract. 
 
  Unless otherwise required under the Contract, WLT shall be co nducted on working piles to a 
minimum 2 times of the characteristic load acting on the piles.  Generally WLT shall be conducted 
when about 30-40% of piles are completed for each block and/or otherwise directed by the SO 
Rep as these are proof test on working piles to ascertain contr actor’s workmanship. The SO Rep 
shall select the test pile and decide when testing can commence  and the Contractor shall 
proceed with testing only after the instruction of the SO Rep h as been given to him to test the 
pile. As soon as a test pile has been selected the Contractor s hall prepare for the test without 
delay. All selected test piles must be tested within two weeks from the date of selection. 
    
 
 (b)    Ultimate load test (ULT) 
   The Contractor shall include in the Contract Sum the number o f ultimate load tests (including the 
installation of the test piles) and the pile instrumentations a s specified by the SO Rep for the 
whole contract.  
 
 
2.21 ULTIMATE LOAD TEST 
 
 The Ultimate Load Test (ULT) on a test pile shall be conducted  before the installation of the working 
piles, and/or otherwise directed by the SO Rep. The ULT is cond ucted to determine the expected 
settlement and the ultimate capacity of the pile, and to check the pile integrity. It shall be a pile different 
from the working pile. Unless otherwise required under the Cont ract, No Ultimate Load Test shall be 
conducted on a working pile. 
 
 For instrumented ULT, the pile is tested to 3 times of the cha racteristic load acting on the piles. The 
Ultimate Load Test on a test pile will be deemed to fail if, 
 
 (a)  its settlement under the test load  
 
  (i)  exceeds 25mm at 2 times of the characteristic load; or  
  (ii)  continues without further load increment before or at 2 .5 times of the characteristic load; 
 o r  
  (iii)  does not meet other requirements as specified in the r elevant clauses of the Eurocodes, 
Singapore National Annexes; or   
 
 (b)  any portion of the pile has failed, crumbled or distorted  from its original position; or  
 
 (c)  the load test cannot be completed for any reason.  
 
 In the event of failure of this ultimate load test on the test  pile, instrumented or non-instrumented as the 
case may be, ONE (1) further test (including the installation o f the test piles and pile instrumentations) 
shall be carried out at the Contractor's expense if the failure  is not due to geotechnical failure of the soil. 
If the subsequent test fails again, the ultimate load test resu lts may be used to assess the suitability of 
the pile type, pile design and layout proposed, or further test s (including the installation of the test piles 
and pile instrumentations) may be ordered by the SO's Rep if de emed necessary all at the Contractor’s 
expense if the failure is not due to geotechnical failure of th e soil. 
 
 
 
2.22 LOADING OF TEST PILES  
 
 Adequate facilities and sufficient equipment shall be provided  by the Contractor for at least two (2) load 
tests to proceed simultaneously at any one time.

Sal(151220) 
(DPG) 2.22 LOADING OF TEST PILES (CONT’D) 
  
 (a)  The test load may be applied to the pile by jacking again st kentledge or anchor pile. The clear 
distance between a test pile and any anchor pile shall not be l ess than 3 metres. Where piles 
are in groups, the use of other working piles as anchor piles m ay be allowed subject to the 
approval of the SO Rep. Notwithstanding such approval the Contr actor shall be solely 
responsible for making good as the SO Rep considers necessary a ny damage to such anchor 
piles which are used as permanent piles.  
  (b)  Pile top levels of test piles shall be recorded immediate ly after selection and in any case before 
the erection of kentledge platform. This shall be done by readi ng levels on two diagonally 
opposite corners of the pile top.  
 
 (c)  Before commencement of any pile load testing at site, con tractor’s Professional Engineer (PE) 
supervising the pile load test shall inspect all test equipment  such as surveying level, oil pumps, 
hydraulic jacks and other related equipment are functional and properly calibrated. Contractor’s 
PE shall exercise vigilance to check and verify the calibration  reports issued by the laboratories. 
Contractor’s PE shall check that each of the test equipment use d in the pile load testing bears a 
valid calibration certificate, issued by a SAC-SINGLAS accredit ed laboratory to the full capability 
or capacity of the test equipment. Contractor’s PE should also check for the SAC accreditation 
mark on the endorsed calibration reports and certificates for t he test equipment as proof that the 
services has attained accreditation from SAC, before allowing t hem to be used for pile load 
testing at site. All Certificates shall be submitted to the SO Rep to show the date of last checking 
for accuracy. The last calibration date of all test equipment m ust not be  more than six months 
prior to the test or as directed by the SO Rep. If the equipmen t is frequently used or presumed 
damage or if any of its component is changed, a more recent cal ibration will be needed. 
 
 (d)  The hydraulic pump for the jack shall, when required, be encased in a steel or wooden box under 
lock and key. The area surrounding the test pile shall be cordo ned off by protective fencing.  
 
 (e)  In the preparation of all test piles the Contractor shall  ensure the rigidity of the supports at all 
corners of the platform. If piles are required to support the p latform they shall be installed at 
Contractor's own expense.  
  (f)  If any test is discontinued or fails to reach the specifi ed load due to (a) faulty jack or gauge, (b) 
unstable support of kentledge, (c) cracking in or damage to the  pile, (d) the datums not being set 
out properly, (e) unstable benchmark or scales, (f) pre-jacking  or pre-loading or any other cause, 
then the test shall be abandoned and the results disregarded. A  further test shall be carried out 
at Contractor's own expense. 
 
 (g)  The settlement shall be measured to an accuracy of not le ss than half mm from a datum which 
must be on an immovable structure or be on a pile and it shall not be affected by any movement 
of the ground due to the test loading, driving of piles or any other causes.  
 
 ( h ) For Working Load Test, the test load shall be imposed by equal increments at approved intervals 
of load equivalent to 25% of the characteristic load of the pil e with each load increment being 
maintained for at least 15 minutes until the full test load is reached. This test load at 1 times of 
the characteristics load shall be maintained for 24 hours befor e the operation to load the pile to 
its full test load (2 times of the characteristics load) is con tinued. The full test load shall remain 
for a period of no less than 3 (three) days or as directed by t he SO Rep. The results shall be 
plotted to produce a load-settlement curve. 
 
 (i) For Ultimate Load Test, the test load shall be imposed by equal increments at approved intervals 
of load equivalent to 25% of the characteristics load of the pi le with each load increment being 
maintained for at least 15 minutes until the full test load is reached. This test load at 1 times of 
the characteristics load and at 2 times of the characteristics load shall be maintained for 24 hours 
before the operation to load the pile to its full test load (3 times of the characteristics load) is 
continued. The full test load shall remain for a period of no l ess than 3 (three) days or as directed 
by the SO Rep. The result shall be plotted to produce a load-se ttlement curve.  
 
 (j) All pile load test shall be carried out in compliance with  Eurocodes, Singapore National Annexes.  
Amongst other requirements, a calibrated load gauge and a calib rated pressure gauge shall be 
used to measure the force exerted on the pile under test. 
  (k)  The use of Rapid Load Test (RLT) and interpretation of th e test results shall comply with Joint 
BCA/IES/ACES/GEOSS Circular 2016: Requirements on Ground Invest igations, Load Test and 
Quality Control Test for Foundations, BS EN ISO 22477-10, ASTM D 7383-08 or equivalent

(DPG) 2.23 FAILURE OF WORKING LOAD TEST  
 
 A Working Load Test shall be deemed to have failed if the sett lement exceeds 25 mm at 2 times of the 
characteristics load for driving steel piles, large diameter bo red piles, jack-in piles, micropiles, precast 
reinforced concrete piles and timber piles.  
  
 For pile subjected to negative skin friction, the working load  test can be performed in the normal manner, 
but with its acceptance subject to satisfaction of an additiona l criterion that pile settlement at the test 
load of 1.0 time column load plus 2.0 times negative friction s hould not exceed 10mm. 
 
 If a working pile so tested as herein specified, fails to sust ain the full characteristics test load over a 
period of 3 days or as directed by the SO Rep then TWO further tests on other piles in any block at the 
same area selected by the SO Rep shall be carried out as direct ed by the SO Rep at Contractor's own 
expense. Where a pile fails under test, compensating piles, as directed by the SO Rep shall be provided 
and the group retested if deemed necessary by the SO Rep, the w hole of the work shall be carried out 
at the Contractor's own expense.  
 
 
 
2.24 SOUNDNESS OF WORK  
  The Contractor shall be aware that load tests on piles are con ducted for the purpose of studying the 
behaviour of piles and in particular settlement under load. As not every pile can be tested, the Contractor 
shall ensure that all piles are installed such that the total s ettlement or differential settlement shall be 
limited to a maximum angle of 1:500 so that the building to be supported will not be damaged due to 
settlement. For bored piles in buildings of ten(10) storeys or taller, the Contractor shall monitor and 
submit the settlement records at various selected columns to th e SO's Rep. 
 
 The acceptance of a few piles which pass the load tests does n ot relieve the Contractor from the 
responsibility for the soundness of the whole of the pile found ation. The Contractor shall be solely 
responsible for ensuring that all the piles are installed to su ch a depth that the required resistance is 
obtained.  
  
2.25 ULTIMATE LOAD TEST AND STANDARD LOAD TEST REPORT  
 
 Three sets of test reports, endorsed by the Contractor's Profe ssional Engineer, shall be submitted to 
the SO Rep three working days after the completion of the test.  The test reports shall contain such 
detailed information such as background, soil log, details of t he test pile, test procedures, full analysis 
of the test results, etc. In addition, for the Ultimate Load Te st report, the actual coordinates (Northing 
and Easting) of the test pile(s) must be indicated. These coord inates must be set out by the Contractor’s 
Registered Surveyor. The reports must also be properly bound in  booklet form.  
 
 If the pile tested failed to sustain the required load or if t he pile top settlement exceeds the permitted 
settlement specified, the report shall also contain an analysis  of the pile behaviour concerning the pile 
settlement. Recommended measure on improving the pile performan ce shall also be included.  
 
 
2.26 MULTIPLE FAILURE OF WORKING PILES  
  A block containing up to 300 piles will be deemed to have fail ed if 3 tests therein fail.  
  In the event of such failure, the Contractor shall carry out s ufficient further piling in accordance with the 
contract document as will ensure the safety of the buildings wh ich are to be carried by the piles. The 
whole of such work shall be executed at the Contractor's expens e, and the cost of amending pile caps 
and ground beams arising out of this, if any, shall be borne by  the Contractor.

cut-off level and any other necessary works for the completion of the operation.  
 
 Immediately after piling is completed in a block, the Contract or shall check and record the exact actual 
position of every pile as compared with the positions indicated  on the drawings. Excavation and cutting 
of piles to the required cut-off levels (+/- 25 mm) shall follo w immediately. Test loading of working piles 
shall commence immediately after a selection is made by the SO Rep and may be carried out before 
the completion of piling in the block.  
 
 In the cutting of piles, the Contractor shall employ a Registe red Surveyor to be responsible for the 
measurement of pile eccentricities and cut-off levels, includin g those for compensating piles. The 
Contractor shall make available all facilities and equipment fo r the SO Rep to confirm the measurement 
 
 All the above works shall take no more than 3 (three) weeks as  from the date the last pile is driven in 
the block regardless of inclement weather or testing time.

UPVC pipe of approved quality with a prelaid 3mm diameter wire inside the UPVC pipe within each 
cast-in-situ pile. The Contractor shall be paid separately for the installation of these UPVC pipes with 
wires based on the pay length as a variation to the tender sum.  The payment for the UPVC pipe with 
the wire shall be based on the pay length (measured from the sp ecified cut-off level of the pile to the 
end of the pile) as recorded and verified in the “As-Built Pile  Penetration Plan”. The UPVC pipe with 
prelaid wire shall be placed from the base of the bored hole to  the ground level for checking the length 
of each completed bored pile immediately after concreting and c apped. 
   
 The UPVC pipe shall include joints and stoppers at the top and  bottom ends of the pipe and the 3mm 
diameter wire shall be prelaid inside it from bottom of the pil e to 0.5m above the cut off level prior to 
capping of the UPVC pipe. The prelaid wire, UPVC pipe thickness , glue length for joints, strength of

shall be rejected. All piles driven unduly out of position, or driven out of plumb in excess of 1 in 75, or if 
no set can be obtained after driving for a considerable length well in excess of estimated penetration 
based on soil data and site condition, shall be rejected. In si tuation where a dolly is used, the pile shall 
be rejected if it does not achieve the allowable set and the fu ll length of the dolly has been utilised to 
drive the pile. 
 2.36.13 Compensating Piles 
  All piles driven into ground and rejected shall be replaced wi th compensating pile or piles at the 
Contractor's own costs and expenses. The position and number of  compensating pile(s) as decided by 
the SO Rep shall be such that the concentricity of the pile gro up is not altered. The Employer will only 
pay the cost for the original number and size of pile(s) in the  pile group as shown in the Drawings. In 
the computation for payment, the size of the original pile as s hown in the Drawings and the pay length 
of the compensating pile shall be taken. If two or more compens ating piles are used to replace the 
rejected pile, the computation shall be based on the size of th e original pile as shown in the Drawings 
and the shortest pay length of the compensating pile (which com pensate the particular rejected pile, as 
decided by the SO Rep). If there are two or more rejected piles  in the same pile group and there is no 
indication which compensating piles are for which rejected pile s (as decided by the SO Rep), the 
computation for payment shall be based on the sizes of the orig inal piles as shown in the Drawings and 
the two or more shortest pay length of the compensating piles. 
 2.36.14 Cutting Of Piles 
 
 Excavate and cut off the pile to the required level shown on t he pile layout Drawings or otherwise 
directed by the SO Rep. Checking and recording of cut-off level  shall be followed up immediately. 
Precast concrete pile shall be stripped to the cut-off level to  expose the longitudinal reinforcement bars 
leaving the dressed head of the pile projecting 75mm into the p ilecap. The longitudinal steel shall be 
left projecting 600mm above the dressed head level and cast int o the pilecap. 
 
 In the cutting of piles, the Contractor shall employ a registe red surveyor to be responsible for the 
measurement of pile eccentricities and cut-off levels, includin g those for compensating piles, and to 
check and endorse the pile eccentricity drawings for submission  to the SO Rep. The Contractor shall 
make available all facilities and equipment for the SO Rep to c onfirm the measurement.

reinforcement bars complying with BS 4449 or SS 560 and welded steel fabric complying with SS 561.  
  Reinforcement shall be free from pitting, loose rust, mill sca le, paint, oil, grease, adhering earth or any 
other material that may impair the bond between the concrete an d the reinforcement or that may cause 
corrosion of the reinforcement or disintegration of the concret e. 
  Where reinforcement is to be welded, it shall comply with SS E N 1992.  The Contractor shall obtain the 
approval of the SO Rep in writing prior to any welding of reinf orcement. 
  4.5.2 Testing 
  The Contractor shall provide the SO Rep every facility for ins pection and sampling before any cutting, 
bending or other fabrication is undertaken.  If deemed necessar y, the SO Rep may cause samples to 
be taken from reinforcement already fixed in position. 
  Samples for the tests shall be sent for testing at the accredi ted laboratory under Singapore Accreditation 
Council (SAC), or other accredited body under the Mutual Recogn ition Arrangements (MRA) with SAC. 
For each sample, 3 bars shall be taken for testing. Reinforceme nt not complying with the appropriate 
Specifications shall be removed and replaced. 
  
4.5.3 Galvanised Steel

4.16.2 Compliance Of Strength Requirement 
 
 The 28 day strength shall be required for compliance with the strength specified hereunder. The early 
strength tests shall be required for quality control purposes. 
 
 For precast concrete, the 3 day strength shall be obtained sol ely for quality control purpose.  Early 
strength requirements to meet design strength for demoulding, h andling and delivery shall be specified 
by the approved manufacturer of the precast components and appr oved by the SO Rep. Such strength 
shall be determined from the additional cubes.  The SO Rep shal l have the absolute right to reject any 
precast component should its early strength fails to meet the d esign strength requirements. 
 
 Compliance with the specified characteristic strength shall be  judged by tests made on cubes at the 
age of 28 days.  Compliance may be assumed if the following con ditions are satisfied: 
 
 (a) The average strength of the sample and the preceding three  samples or the average of the first 
four samples of the production is greater than or equal to the specified characteristic strength 
plus half a fixed current margin of 6 N per mm².  Thus, the minimum average strength shall be : 
 
 Grade 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 
 Minimum Average 
Strength at 28 days (N 
per mm²) 23.0 28.0 33.0 38.0 43.0 48.0 53.0  
 
 (b) The sample strength is at least the level specified below :

 (c) The characteristics strength shall meet the requirement of  the specified concrete grade. 
 
 If a current margin lower than the fixed current margin can be  consistently achieved, approval may be 
sought to lower the strength level as specified in subclause (a ) above. 
 
 For samples taken on the Site, if the sample strength results do not comply with either or both of the 
requirements specified above, the SO Rep shall exercise his rig hts under Clause 1.6 "Nuisance and 
Irregularities" to impose charges against the Contractor.  
 
 All test cubes taken shall be properly stored and the Contract or shall ensure that all test cubes are 
tested at their respective age.  Test cube that are lost shall be deemed to have failed and the SO Rep 
shall exercise his rights under Clause 1.6 "Nuisance and Irregu larities" to impose charges against the

concrete component with minor chipping  and spalling, and non-s tructural crack may be installed before carrying out 
repair by approved patching method and to the satisfaction of t he SO Rep. If such minor defects are not easily 
accessible for repair after erection, the precast concrete comp onent shall  be repaired prior to erection. 
 
 Check and ensure the accuracy of location of all bearing surfa ces and all anchorages for precast concrete 
components. Any deviations from the Drawings noted shall be cor rected according to method approved by SO Rep 
prior to the start of erection. Bearing surfaces, notches, bolt s, connection angles or plates shall be checked as to 
level, line and grade. 
  Whenever inserts or lifting hooks are used for erection purpos es, their location and type of anchor used shall be 
checked for compliance with the location as specified in the Ap proved Workshop Drawings. Anchorage length and 
exposed length of lifting hooks shall be checked for compliance  with that specified in the design. The inserts or lifting 
hooks shall be properly secured before casting. If slings are u sed, the precast concrete components shall be marked 
so that the slings are placed at the proper locations.  
 
 Field conditions shall be determined by actual measurement so that precast concrete components and joint sealants 
installed satisfy design or specification requirements and are within the specified erection tolerances. As and when 
instructed by the SO Rep, the precast concrete components shall  be cleaned and repaired after installation.

(DPG) 7.4 ANCHORAGE DEVICES 
 
 Anchorage devices shall be subjected to the approval of the SO  Rep.  Each anchorage device shall be 
capable of transmitting a force not less than the ultimate tens ile strength of the tendon without 
overstressing the concrete.  Spiral or other reinforcement spec ified by the manufacturer as being 
required for this purpose shall be considered part of the ancho rage devices and shall be of the size and 
dimensions recommended by the Manufacturer for the prestressing  system being used.  Certificates of 
origin shall be provided for all anchorage devices. 
 
 No damaged or defective anchorage devices shall be used.  All steel parts shall be protected from 
corrosion and all threaded parts and fittings shall be protecte d by wrappings or plugs until used. The 
anchorage devices shall be kept free from mortar, loose rust, g rease, tar, paint, oil, mud or any other 
coatings. 
 
 
7.5 SHEATHING 
 
 All Sheathing shall be subject to the approval of the SO Rep.  Sheathing shall be of the type suitable 
for the prestressing system to be used and shall be strong enou gh for withstanding the placing and 
compaction of the concrete without suffering damages or deforma tion.  Internal and external diameters 
of sheathing shall be within the limits specified in the design  or approved by the SO Rep. The sheathing 
and all splices shall be mortar tight.  Steel sheathing shall b e galvanised or lead coated.  The 
Manufacturer's value for the friction coefficients of the propo sed sheathing shall be stated by the 
Contractor.  Enlarged portions of the sheathing at couplings or  anchorages shall be of sufficient length 
to provide for the extension of tendons. 
 
 Grout holes shall be provided at both ends of the sheathing an d shall be at least 10mm diameter. Each 
of the grouting holes shall be equipped with a plug valve or si milar device capable of withstanding a 
pressure of 1 N per mm² without loss of water, grout or air.  A dditional vents, with plug valves, shall 
be provided at suitable points in the sheathing, including high  and low points, for the purpose of bleeding 
air and water to ensure the complete filling of the duct with g rout.  The number and location of these 
additional vents shall be as specified in the design. 
  Sheathing for prevention tendons shall consist of plastic tubi ng or other approved material of a quality, 
diameter and thickness approved by the SO Rep.  Sheathing shall  continue through end forms for at 
least 25mm. 
  7.6 PLACEMENT OF TENDONS 
  (a) Post-tensioned Tendons 
   Unless otherwise stated in the Drawings or approved by the SO  Rep, tendons shall be sheathed 
and placed in position prior to concreting.  Where permanent te ndons cannot be placed, 
temporary tendons or other methods approved by the SO Rep shall  be used to stiffen the 
sheathing.  Tendons sha ll be handled with care and shall be pul led through the sheathing in such 
a manner as to avoid damage or contamination to either the tend on or the sheathing. 
 
  Sheathing shall be securely fixed at points sufficiently clos e together to maintain a smooth tendon 
profile throughout the length of the tendon within a tolerance of 3mm of the position shown.  If in 
the opinion of the SO Rep, the sheathing is liable to be damage d or deformed during concreting 
work, the Contractor shall take additional precautions to maint ain the position and shape of the 
sheathing. 
 
  Any temporary opening in the sheathing shall be plugged and a ll joints between sheathing and 
any other part of the prestressing system shall be effectively sealed to prevent the entry of mortar, 
dust, water or other deleterious matter.  Sheathing shall be ne atly fitted at joints without projection 
or reduction of diameter, and the joints shall be mortar tight.  
 
  Immediately after the whole of the concrete has been placed, all tendons therein shall be pulled 
back and forth for about 300mm to ensure that they are perfectl y free inside the sheaths.  Ducts 
stiffened by temporary tendons shall be checked by passing thro ugh a tendon identical with the 
permanent tendon.

(DPG) 7.6 PLACEMENT OF TENDONS  (CONT'D) 
 
 (a) Post-tensioned Tendons  (Cont'd) 
 
  Unless otherwise specified, the minimum concrete cover to the  outside surface of any sheathing 
shall be 50mm for beam soffits and 40mm elsewhere.  This minimu m cover shall be increased 
by 15mm for members in contact with earth or water or over salt  water and by 25mm for members 
in contact with salt water. 
 
  Each anchorage device shall be set square to the line of the corresponding prestressing tendon 
and shall be positioned securely to prevent movement during con creting.  The anchorage 
devices shall be cleaned to the satisfaction of the SO Rep.  An y mortar or concrete which adheres 
to the bearing or wedging surfaces shall be removed immediately .  Provision shall be made for 
covering anchorages with reinforced concrete after completion o f stressing.  The minimum cover 
shall be 50mm over the anchorages and 40mm over the reinforceme nt. 
 
 (b) Pretensioned Tendons 
   Tendons shall be located as shown on the Drawings and suitabl e devices shall be provided to 
ensure that the correct positioning of the tendons is maintaine d during casting. 
 
  When tendons are being placed, particular care shall be taken  so that the tendons shall not come 
into contact with the oiled surface of the forms or be otherwis e soiled.  Any oil, etc which might 
collect on the tendons shall be removed by cleaning the affecte d tendons with a petrol-soaked 
rag or by other approved methods. 
 
  The anchorages shall be such as to prevent any slip during th e casting or curing operations. 
 
  Unless as shown otherwise in the Drawings, the concrete cover  to the surface of any tendon 
shall not be less than twice the tendon diameter or 25mm whiche v e r  i s  t h e  g r e a t e r .   S u c h  
minimum cover shall be increased by 15mm for members situated i n earth or water or over salt 
water. 
  7.7 CONCRETING 
  Concrete in one precast unit shall be placed in one operation continuously without interruption.  The 
Contractor shall provide such protective cover as and when requ ired to avoid stoppage due to sudden 
rain.  No unit shall be removed from the mould or erected until  sufficiently matured to ensure that no 
damage shall be done to the unit.  For post-tensioned construct ion, where necessary, temporary 
openings shall be provided in the formwork to enable placing an d adequate compaction of concrete, 
especially around and underneath sheathing and anchorages. 
 
 Care shall be taken to avoid damaging the sheathing.  Vibrator s shall not come into contact with the 
sheathing and if the sheathing is damaged during concreting, th e whole or a portion of the concrete 
cast may be rejected by the SO Rep.  Sheathing shall be cleaned  out within half an hour of completion 
of each concreting operation by blowing oil-free compressed air  through the length of the sheathing.  
The concrete shall be moist cured until the prestress is applie d. 
 
 
7.8 CONCRETE STRENGTH AT TRANSFER 
  No post-tensioning of tendons or the release of pretensioned t endons shall take place until the concrete 
has attained the minimum strength required as stated in the Dra wings or as specified. These 
requirements shall be ascertained from tests on concrete cubes made and cured under the same 
conditions as the concrete member.  Sufficient cubes shall be m ade so that if the stipulated strength is 
not achieved, further cubes will be available for such addition al testing as may be required.

(DPG) 7.9 TENSIONING EQUIPMENT 
 
 All tensioning equipment shall be approved by the SO Rep prior  to use.  Hydraulic pumps shall be power 
driven and the power unit shall be so adjusted that the rate of  extension of the tendon is within the limits 
recommended or as directed by the SO Rep.  Dynamometers, and ea ch set of equipment comprising 
pump, jack and pressure gauge shall be calibrated as directed b y the SO Rep and the true force 
determined from the calibration.  Dynamometers, pressure gauges  and scales shall permit force and 
elongation to be determined within an accuracy of 2%. 
 
 Pressure gauges shall only be used as a substitute for dynamom eters and shall be concentric scale 
gauges complying with the requirements of BS EN 837-1 which req uires gauges to be accurate to within 
1% of their full capacity.  They shall be selected so as to be used between the 50% and 90% of their 
full capacity and shall not be less than 200mm in diameter.  Wh ere pressure gauges are used, a suitable 
device shall be fitted so as to protect the gauge against sudde n release of pressure.  Provision shall 
also be made by such means as a "tee" connection, for the attac hment of a second gauge which shall 
be attached and used as a check whenever so requested by the SO  Rep. 
 
 
7.10 TENSIONING PRECAUTIONS 
  All tensioning operations shall be carried out in the presence  of the SO Rep in accordance with the best 
practice applicable to the particular prestressed method propos ed.  The tensioning operation shall be 
performed only by personnel trained and experienced in this typ e of work. 
 
 Care shall be taken during tensioning to ensure the safety of all personnel engaged on the work and of 
other persons in the vicinity.  Jacks shall be secured in such a manner that they will be restrained should 
they loose their grip on the tendons.  No person shall be permi tted to stand behind the jacks or close to 
the line of the tendons while tensioning is in progress.  The o peration of jacks, the measurements of 
elongation and associated operations shall be carried out in su ch a manner and from such positions 
that the safety of all concerned is ensured.  During actual str essing operations warning signs shall be 
prominently displayed.  Where, in the opinion of the SO Rep, th ere is danger to the general public or to 
property, special precautions in the form of substantial barrie r shall be required. 
  7.11 TENSIONING FORCE 
  Unless otherwise specified, the tensioning forces required sha ll be that shown in the Drawings.  The 
tensioning force applied to any tendon shall be determined by d irect measurement of the force and 
checked by measurement of the elongation of the tendon.  The se cant modulus determined from test 
samples or shown on test certificates shall be used when interp reting the measurement of elongation. 
Allowance shall be made for any anticipated draw-in at the anch orage devices on release of the jack, 
for elastic shortening of the member and for anticipated losses  due to stressing of subsequent tendons. 
The final forces in each tendon, as measured by the dynamometer , shall be within an accuracy of plus 
or minus 3% of the values stipulated. 
 
 If, on completion of tensioning each tendon to the required fo rce, the check measurement of elongation 
differs from its required value by more than 5%, the SO Rep may  direct that some or all of the following 
steps be taken : 
 
 (a) Recalibration of equipment; 
  (b) Testing of tendon material to check secant modulus;  
 (c) Tendons released and restressed (secant modulus applicable  to second stressing 
  to be adopted); 
 
 (d) Lubrication of tendons to reduce friction losses.  Only wa ter soluble oils shall be used 
  in ducted systems and these shall be washed out before grouti ng; 
 
 (e) Where only 1 jack is used previously, the tendon shall be tensioned from both ends 
  using 2 jacks;   (f) Other methods as directed by the SO Rep.

Sal(151220) 
(DPG) 7.12 PRETENSIONING 
 
 The abutments and casting beds for pretensioning of tendons sh all be strong enough to withstand the 
required total prestressing force with adequate safety.  The ab utments shall be so constructed as to 
provide protection at all times against injury or damage caused  by slipping occurring in anchorages 
during or after tensioning.  Provisions shall be made for free and adequate movement of the member 
at points of support in the direction of the expected shortenin g due to prestress without impairing the 
rigidity of the forms during casting operations.  Where necessa ry, provision shall be made in the design 
of the casting bed for the use of external vibrators. 
 
 In the case where tendons are to be deflected, submit details of the proposed layout for each line of 
tendons together with values for the portion of the force to be  provided by the initial tensioning and for 
the portion which will be provided by the elongation resulting from subsequent deflection of the tendons. 
Tensioning shall not commence until the SO Rep has approved the  values submitted. 
 
 Special care shall be taken to apply tensioning force smoothly  at an even rate and to determine its value 
with considerable accuracy.  Tendons shall be marked for measur ement of elongation and shall also 
be marked at both the jacking and dead ends of the stressing be d so that any slip may be observed.  
Should a slip of any of the tendons in a group of tendons tensi oned together occur, the tensioning of 
the whole group shall be released, tendons reset, and the whole  group tensioned again.  Alternatively, 
the tensioning of the group of tendons can be completed without  the slipped tendon(s) which can be 
subsequently tensioned. 
  The prestressing force shall be transferred from the jack to t he abutment of the stressing bed 
immediately the required force (or elongation) has been reached  and the pressure in the jack shall be 
relaxed before any other operation commences.  Tendons shall be  deflected, where shown in the 
Drawings and the required force maintained, by use of approved fixing devices strong enough to hold 
the tendons firmly in their proper positions especially during concreting and curing, until the concrete 
has attained the required strength. 
 
 In order that the required force is maintained after the tensi oned steel has been anchored, an allowance 
shall be made in assessing the value of the applied force for l oss of stress due to yield in the anchorages 
and for slip when the steel is wedged after tensioning.  In lon g line beds, due consideration shall be 
given to the friction caused by the varying shape and number of  diaphgrams. 
 
 Prior to concreting, a check shall be made of the accuracy of alignment of forms and of the distance 
centre to centre bearings, overall length, width, positioning o f end blocks, tendons, sheathing and 
anchorages and their connections, reinforcement, bearings, dowe ls and any other fittings shown in the 
Drawings.  Concreting of a member shall not commence until the approval of the SO Rep has been 
obtained. 
  Prior to transfer of the prestressing force from the abutments  of the casting bed to the members, all 
tendons shall be tested for tightness and any loose tendon foun d shall be reported to the SO Rep who 
will decide whether the members are acceptable.  All tendons sh all be marked at each end of every 
member so as to check the draw-in and any slip of the tendons.  The procedure of release shall be 
continuous and shall be performed in the shortest possible time  without interruption.  The prestress 
shall be transferred to the members in such a manner that the t endons are released gradually and, 
preferably, simultaneously.  The method of transferring the pre stress and the equipment proposed shall 
be approved by the SO Rep prior to use.  The SO Rep shall be pr esent at every occasion of releasing 
tendons.  After prestress has been transferred to the members, the tendons between the members shall 
be severed working along the line from the point or points of r elease.  Every effort shall be made to 
avoid injury to the concrete.

Sal(151220) 
(DPG) 7.13 POST-TENSIONING 
 
 The process of prestressing each member shall be continuous, t he tendons being stressed in the order 
indicated in the Drawings, and the operation completed without interruption in as short a time as 
possible. No member shall be left partially prestressed without  the permission of the SO Rep unless the 
Drawings require the member to be prestressed in stages.  In ge neral, tensioning shall proceed 
symmetrically to avoid lateral distortion and development of te nsion on one side.  At no time shall the 
permissible stresses in concrete and steel be exceeded. 
 
 Tendon ducts shall be cleaned out by blowing compressed air th rough them and anchorages shall be 
thoroughly cleaned prior to commencement of tensioning.  The pr otruding ends of tendons shall be 
cleaned of any coating, such as rust, mortar, oil or mud which would lessen the grip of wedges of 
anchorage devices.  Tendons shall be checked before tensioning to see that they are free to move 
inside the duct. 
 
 Special care shall be taken to set the jacks accurately in the  line of the tendon.  The force which is 
applied initially to take up the slack of the tendon shall be s ufficient to seat the jack firmly but shall not 
exceed the amount normally associated with the particular metho d of post-tensioning. After taking up 
the slack, the tendon shall, where possible, be accurately mark ed at both ends and elongations or draw-
in measured from these markings.  When requested by the SO Rep readings of force and elongation 
shall be taken at stages during the tensioning of a tendon and plotted to determine the zero error in 
measuring elongation.  Where tendons consist of a number of ind ividual components, each component 
shall be marked so that any slip may be observed. 
 
 In the case of slipping of one or more components or tendons o f a group tensioned together, the SO 
Rep may permit a compensating increase in the elongation of the  remaining tendons of the group 
provided that the jacking force does not exceed 80% of the mini mum ultimate tensile strength of the 
remaining tendons.  In the case of a tendon breaking or slippin g after tensioning, the tendon shall be 
released, replaced if necessary, and restressed.  Under no circ umstances shall the maximum jacking 
force exceeds the rated capacity of the jacking equipment used,  or 80% of the specified minimum 
ultimate strength of the tendon whichever is less. 
  7.14 TENSIONING RECORDS 
 
 All tensioning data shall be recorded and submitted to the SO Rep for checking and retention : 
  (a) Pretensioned Tendons 
 
  The following data relating to the prestressing operation sha ll be recorded : 
   (i) Identification numbers of dynamometers, gauges, pumps and  jacks; 
 
  (ii) Force applied if dynamometer is used; alternatively, pum p or jack pressure and area 
   o f  p i s t o n ;  
 
  (iii) Elongation remaining after anchoring. 
 
 (b) Post-Tensioned Tendons 
   The following data, where applicable, shall be recorded :    (i) Identification number of each dynamometer, gauge, pump an d jack; 
 
  (ii) Identification particulars of tendons; 
 
  (iii) Initial forces (or pressures) when tendons are marked f or measurement of elongation; 
 
  (iv) Final forces (or pressure) and elongations obtained on c ompletion of tensioning; 
 
  (v) Elongation remaining after release of jacks;    (vi) Elongations obtained at intervals during tensioning, tog ether with corresponding forces 
   (or pressures), if and when required by the SO Rep.

(DPG) 7.15 GROUTING 
 
 After post-tensioned tendons have been tensioned and anchored they shall be pressure-grouted as 
soon as practicable.  The grout mix and the method of mixing an d injecting the grout shall be approved 
by the SO Rep before grouting is commenced.  The pressure at wh ich the grout is to be pumped into 
the duct shall be approved by the SO Rep and shall not normally  exceed 0.7 N per mm². 
 
 The grout shall preferably be either a neat cement grout with a water to cement ratio not exceeding 0.4 
or cement mortar (1:1 3/4 by weight).  An approved expanding pl asticising admixture shall be used.  
Grout shall be mixed in a high speed mechanical mixer, for at l east 2 minutes, until a uniform colloidal 
consistency is produced.  Mixing by hand shall not be permitted .  Pumps shall be capable of continuous 
operation with little pressure variation and shall have a syste m for recirculating the grout whilst actual 
grouting is not in progress.  Pumps shall be fitted with a pres sure gauge and shall be capable of delivery 
at pressures up to 1.0 N per mm².  All equipment, especially pi ping, shall be thoroughly washed with 
clean water after each series of operations and more frequently  if necessary. 
 
 Grouting shall not be carried out while the shade temperature exceeds 38°C.  All ducts and holes shall 
be thoroughly flushed out with clean water followed by compress ed air. Grout shall be injected into each 
duct at a speed between 300mm and 600mm per second.  A continuo usly steady flow of grout shall be 
maintained until the duct is completely filled and pure grout i ssues from all vents and from the far end 
and until all entrapped air has been expelled.  The vents shall  be progressively closed as required to 
ensure the complete filling of the duct.  The grout pressure sh all then be held at the required value for 
at least 1 minute after which the grouting end shall be plugged .  All vents and ends shall be kept closed 
until final setting of the grout has taken place.  When directe d by the SO Rep, duct openings shall be 
inspected 2 or 3 days after grouting and topped up if necessary . 
 
 If serious leaks occur, the grouting shall be stopped, the duc t flushed clean with water and the leakage 
plugged before continuing with grouting.  If a blockage occurs,  pumping may be quickly transferred to 
the far end of the duct if there are sufficient vents to ensure  that the duct will be filled with grout. 
Alternatively, ducts may be flushed with clean water to clear t he blockage.  The Contractor shall be 
responsible for the complete filling of the ducts with grout.  If several blockages occur the grout mix may 
be rejected and a new mix designed. 
  On completion of grouting and after the grout has hardened suf ficiently, any vents or grouting tubes 
which extend to the surfaces of the concrete shall be cut off 2 5mm below the concrete surface and the 
recess plugged with concrete.  Tendons shall be cut back to giv e, when recesses are concreted, a 
minimum of 25mm cover.  Wire stubs (if any) may be bent into th e recesses.  Recesses shall be 
concreted, or, when shown in the Drawings, shall be filled mono lithically when other cast-in-place 
concrete is placed. 
 
 Complete records shall be kept on all grouting of ducts and a copy of the records submitted to the SO 
Rep. 
 
 
7.16 PRESTRESSED MEMBERS 
 
 Workmanship displayed in the construction of prestressed membe rs shall be of the highest order and 
every endeavour shall be made to obtain accuracy of dimensions.   The dimensions and shape stated 
in the Drawings shall be taken to apply to the structure at the  time of its completion when under self 
weight alone.  Except where stated otherwise in the Drawings or  approved by the SO Rep, the 
dimensions and profile of the formwork shall compensate for def ormations due to prestress, etc so that 
the dimensions and profile of the completed structure will conf orm to the Drawings.  Submit details of 
the magnitude of these deformations and the proposed method to allow for them. Construction of 
formwork shall not commence until the approval of the SO Rep ha s been obtained.

 For precast members, the date of casting, length of member and  the identification number required by 
the SO Rep shall be marked on every member.  When requested by the SO Rep, the word 'TOP' and/or 
lifting positions shall also be marked on the member.  All acce pted members shall be clearly identified 
by marking in the presence of the SO Rep.  Members shall not be  lifted or handled until fully stressed. 
At all times, and especially during transportation, members sha ll be secured in proper positions by 
means of suitable packing pieces and braces.  Members shall not  be braced against one another but 
shall be provided with independent bracing.  Members shall be h andled, lifted and supported carefully 
at the positions and in the manner required by the Drawings.  W here no method of lifting is shown in 
the Drawings, submit for the approval of the SO Rep, details of  proposals for lifting the members and 
once approved no other method shall be used during the whole pe riod of construction except with the 
permission of the SO Rep. 
 
 Precast members shall be supported on timber bearers or other approved means, over their full width. 
The ground or space between the bearers supporting the members shall be carefully cleared and 
levelled so as to prevent the member from being accidentally su pported other than on the approved 
bearers.  The bearers themselves shall be supported on firm fou ndation and, every precaution shall be 
made to prevent subsidence from occurring.  Members shall not b e stacked on top of one another 
except when approved by the SO Rep who shall determine the mann er of stacking and the maximum 
number of layers or height of the stacking.  Each layer shall b e separated from the next layer by bearers. 
  No precast member which is manufactured outside the Site shall  be delivered to the Site without the 
permission of the SO Rep.  The granting of permission shall be dependent on each individual member 
exhibiting satisfactory workmanship and finish and complying wi th the tolerance on dimensions and 
prestressing force.  In addition, test loading, if specified, a nd concrete strength tests of representative 
members shall satisfy the requirements specified.

20.11.1 Wall Tiling Method 
 
 The Contractor shall carry out wall tiling according to the fo llowing procedure : 
  (a) Clean the background to remove all laitance, dust, oil or other substances that affect the bonding 
of rendering.  The background shall be washed using water jet. 
 
 (b) Apply rendering to the background to a finished thickness not exceeding 10mm to achieve a flat 
and even surface.  The background shall be first dampened to pr event excessive absorption of 
water from the rendering before its placing.  The rendering sha ll be increased to a finished 
thickness not exceeding 18mm to allow for concealment of water piping. 
 
 (c) Allow the rendering to set for at least 12 hours. 
  (d) Apply a layer of bedding mortar onto the rendered substrat e and spread another layer as thin as 
possible on the full back of the tiles before placing tiles in position.  The keys, frogs or 
depressions at the back of the tile shall be completely filled with mortar before fixing. 
  (e) Place each tile and tap it firmly into position to ensure that each tile makes contact over its whole 
area.  Tile spacers shall be used for laying of wall tiles to a chieve consistent joint width.  The tile 
spacers to be used shall be approved by the SO Rep prior to the  commencement of the tiling 
works. 
 
 (f) Adjust the position of any tile within 5 minutes of fixing .  
 
  The grouting to all tile joints shall commence within 7 days after fixing the wall tiles.  Dust or 
foreign materials shall be removed from the joints.  The grout shall be wet mixed mechanically 
before application.  It shall be spread with a grout spreader ( rubber squeegee or grout trowel), 
working back and forth over the area until the joints are compl etely filled.  Excess grout shall be 
removed with the aid of a spreader and a damp (not) wet cloth.  After the grout has stiffened 
slightly, tool the grout with a piece of wood or other suitable  tool to a consistent depth and shape. 
After the grout has dried, the tile surface shall be cleaned an d given a final polish using a clean, 
dry cloth. 
   The contractor shall lay and finish the wall tiles corner int erface with mitre joints. The mitred joint 
edge should be properly chamfered and straight. The edges shoul d also be relatively smooth, 
and should not be jagged or flaked.

application to the SO Rep for approval prior to the commencemen t of the tiling works. 
   The tile adhesive shall be applied onto the surface of rendere d wall and then notch-trowelled to a 
finishes thickness not exceeding the manufacturer’s recommendat ion. The area of application shall not 
exceed 1m2. in each application. The tile adhesive shall also b e spread uniformly ove r the back of each 
tile to fill deep keys and all remaining depressions. The tile shall then be placed into the position and 
be tapped firmly to ensure its full contact with the adhesive. 
  The tile adhesive shall be stored and used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The 
normal set tile adhesive shall comply with the following requir ements specified in Clause 19.7.7 “Tile 
Adhesive”. 
 20.11.4 Testing Of Tensile Pull-Out Strength 
  The Contractor shall conduct tensile pull-out tests on wall ti les according to the Schedule Of Material 
Tests.  Each test shall determine the tensile pull-out strength s of five randomly selected pieces of tiles 
within a room.  The joint around the tile shall be cut to the d epth of the joint before the pull-out test. The 
test shall be conducted within 21 to 28 days after fixing the t iles.

The outer surface of the pipe shall be roughened with glass pap er or sandpaper and a coat of 
solvent cement applied for its length in the manhole wall. All the ends of flared-mouth pipes shall 
be sealed with end plugs to prevent entry of earth or cement. 
 
 (e) Construction Method 
 
  (i) Where UPVC of less than 16-Ways are to be laid, they shal l be encased in Grade 20 
concrete to a minimum thickness of 50mm as shown to the details  in the COPIF. 
   (ii) Where UPVC are to be laid in multiple formation, polypro pylene spacers shall be used 
at a maximum spacing of 1.5m apart to allow clearance between a djacent pipes. 
 
  (iii) The starting end of the pipe shall be blanked off with a board or boards to prevent 
foreign objects from entering the pipes. When joining multiple pipes, all pipe ends and 
the interior of the collar shall be thoroughly cleaned with a d ry rag followed by a liberal 
coating of solvent cement. The collar shall then be pushed into  the first pipe by hand. A 
suitable wooden batten is then placed across the remote end of the collar and tapped 
with a hammer until it is engaged midway. The next length of pi pe shall then be engaged 
to the collar and similarly tapped until fully engaged. 
 
  (iv) The first layer of concrete shall be placed to the requi red thickness on the prepared 
trench bottom. The bottom layer of the pipes shall then be laid  (using the spacer to 
maintain the spacing between pipes where applicable) such that a minimum gap, 
sufficient for the specified concrete thickness, remains betwee n the outside pipes and 
the side of the trench or trench shuttering where used. The nex t layer of concrete shall 
then be placed to the prescribed thickness before the second la yer of pipes are laid. 
This process shall be continued until the final layer of concre te is laid to the specified 
thickness. The concrete shall be evenly placed around the duct and each batch, as it is 
placed, shall be properly compacted without creating unbalanced  side thrust against 
the pipe. 
 
   Where ready mix concrete is used, the placing of concrete up  to three layers of pipe in 
a single batch is allowed, provided 12mm size diameter vibrator s are used to 
consolidate the concrete filling the spaces between the pipes. 
 
   For pipeline encased with 100mm thick concrete, each batch s hall be well compacted 
and worked around the pipe and vibrated using a vibrator. The s pace between the pipes 
shall be properly tamped with a 12mm diameter rod to ensure tha t the concrete is 
properly filled. The final layer of concrete shall be thoroughl y trowelled. 
 
  (v) When pipes are laid under conditions where backfilling is  required to be carried out 
immediately, approved type of rapid hardening cement additive c ompound shall be 
used with the concrete. 
 
  (vi) All spaces alongside the pipe shall be filled with stone  free earth and hand punned to a 
compacted thickness of not less than 100mm above the top of the  pipe barrel. 
  
  (vii) Where the pipe is recessed into the wall of the manhole , the outside surface of the pipe 
shall be roughened with glass paper or sandpaper and a coat of solvent cement applied 
for its length in the manhole wall.

attached to the handle that is being tested such that there is 300 mm slack on the loop as shown 
in the Drawings (as shown in Appendix A49). 
   After the filled bin has come to rest, the quick-release hook  is disengaged allowing the filled bin 
to fall freely. At all times, the filled bin must not come into  contact with the ground. 
 
  The procedure is repeated for the other handle.

increased by 20 kg per m3 and 40 kg per m3 respectively. 
  In the designing of mixes, a current margin shall be 10 N per mm
2.  If a current margin other than that 
recommended is to be used, sufficient valid data shall be made available to the SO Rep for his 
consideration and approval.  Mix adjustment shall be allowed on ly when sufficient results are available; 
however, such mix shall comply with the Specifications. 
 
 In all cases, it is the responsibility of the Contractor to en sure that the designed mix shall be durable, 
workable and comply with the strength grade requirement as spec ified or as shown. 
 
32.6.2 Trial Mixes 
 
 The designed mix with a designed maximum consistency as measur ed by slump flow, V-funnel, L-box, 
segregation, and loss of slump shall be verified by preparation  of trial mixes witnessed by the SO Rep.  
The mix shall be judged for suitable workability which shall in clude filling ability, viscosity, passing ability, 
stability as well as strength.  A minimum of 18 cubes from thre e batches shall be taken.  The mix may 
be considered suitable if : 
 
(a)  the average strength of the nine cubes tested at 28 days s hall exceed the specified 
 characteristic strength by at least 10 N per mm2  or if the nine cubes at an earlier age indicate 
 that it is likely to be exceeded by this amount; and 
 
(b)  compliance of the following tests in accordance to “The Eu ropean Guideline for Self-
 compacting Concrete” for consistency  
 
(i) Slump flow test & T500  slump flow test;

 The 28 day strength shall be required for compliance with the strength specified hereunder. The early 
strength tests shall be required for quality control purposes. 
 
 For precast concrete, the 3 day strength shall be obtained sol ely for quality control purpose.  Early 
strength requirements to meet design strength for demoulding, h andling and delivery shall be specified 
by the approved manufacturer of the precast components and appr oved by the SO Rep. Such strength 
shall be determined from the additional cubes.  The SO Rep shal l have the absolute right to reject any 
precast component should its early strength fails to meet the d esign strength requirements. 
 
 Compliance with the specified characteristic strength shall be  judged by tests made on cubes at the 
age of 28 days.  Compliance may be assumed if the following con ditions are satisfied: 
 
 (a) The average strength of the sample and the preceding three  samples or the average of the first 
four samples of the production is greater than or equal to the specified characteristic strength 
plus half a fixed current margin of 6 N per mm².  Thus, the minimum average strength shall be : 
 
 Grade 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 
 Minimum Average 
Strength at 28 days (N 
per mm²) 23.0 28.0 33.0 38.0 43.0 48.0 53.0  
 
 (b) The sample strength is at least the level specified below : 
 
 Grade 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 
 Minimum Individual 
Sample Strength at 28 days (N 
per mm
²) 17.0 22.0 27.0 32.0 37.0 42.0 47.0  
 
 (c) The characteristics strength shall meet the requirement of  the specified concrete grade. 
 
 If a current margin lower than the fixed current margin can be  consistently achieved, approval may be 
sought to lower the strength level as specified in sub-clause ( a) above. 
 
 For samples taken on the Site, if the sample strength results do not comply with either or both of the 
requirements specified above, the SO Rep shall exercise his rig hts under Clause 1.6 "Nuisance and 
Irregularities" to impose charges against the Contractor.  
 
 All test cubes taken shall be properly stored and the Contract or shall ensure that all test cubes are 
tested at their respective age.  Test cube that are lost shall be deemed to have failed and the SO Rep 
shall exercise his rights under Clause 1.6 "Nuisance and Irregu larities" to impose charges against the 
Contractor. 
 
 Payment of charges to the Employer shall not in any way affect , vary or relieve the Contractor's 
obligations under the Contract. 
 
 In addition to the payment of charges, the affected concrete W orks may be stopped and not be 
continued until so directed by the SO Rep.  No extension to the  Time for Completion shall be allowed 
for such stoppage of the concrete Works.

water supply for the purpose of testing for leaks in the pipe. 
  (c) Floor Traps 
 
  The gratings to the floor traps in bathrooms and kitchens sha ll be blocked temporarily with 
polythene sheets or by other suitable means and the floor flood ed with about 10mm depth of 
water above the gratings.  The amount of water shall be maintai ned for about 2 hours, 
replenished when necessary, during which the underside of the f loor slab shall be checked for 
signs of leaks.  Towards the end of this test, the water shall be allowed to drain off. During this 
process there shall be no sign of chokage and leakage in the sy stem. The water test shall be 
carried out 3 days after the laying of floor finishes. 
  (d) Water Pumping Plant 
 
  Arrange with the SO Rep for test on the whole pumping Plant i ncluding transfer pump and 
booster pump for signs of leak and proper performance of the pu mps.  Rectify all the Defect 
found during the inspection immediately so that a re-inspection  can be carried out. Arrange for 
the test to be carried out not later than four weeks before the  buildings are handed over to the 
Employer.  Provide electricity for operating the pumps, provide  temporary piping, connections, 
fittings and accessories necessary for the test to be carried o ut. 
  36.14.3 Hydrostatic Test Of Underground Mains

48. 
  After laying, jointing and anchoring of the main and before an y backfilling or concreting, charge the 
piping system slowly and carefully with potable water so that a ll air is expelled.  Test the mains under 
pressure. 
  Before testing the main, fit all open ends of the main with bl ank flange and secure them with struts or 
otherwise to resist the end thrust of the water pressure in the  main.  Apply a test pressure of 125m head 
or the maximum working pressure plus 50% whichever is the great er, by means of manually operated 
test pump or by power-driven test pump. 
 
 Maintain the test pressure by the pump for 1 hour and check th e main for any leakage.  General leakage 
shall not exceed 2 litres per cm of pipe diameter per km of pip e per 100m head per 24 hours. 
Notwithstanding the above, rectify all visual leaks detected.

  The circuit shall generate three signals indicating the fault  level from 0 to 7 in the form of a 3-bit 
binary code; fault level 7 has the highest priority and fault l evel 0 is the no-fault condition.  Fault 
level indication is based on the source (not memory) fault cond ition being on.  If more than one 
fault condition is present, the highest fault level shall be in dicated.  Whenever the fault level 
changes, fault level 0 (no fault) shall be indicated for 30 sec s before the new fault level is 
indicated. 
   These three signals shall drive three relays, R1, R2, and R3 in the lift motor room as well as 
three LED in the control panel. 
   When the repair technician's key switch is on, the correspond ing LED, which is directly controlled 
by the processor, should be on.  This signal shall drive a sepa rate relay R4 in the lift motor room. 
 
  The circuit shall function such that when there is no fault a ll the relays R1, R2, R3 and R4 are 
energized.  Therefore, a by-pass or override switch shall be pr ovided to keep the four relays 
energized when the telemonitoring system is to be isolated for maintenance.

      0 INPUT : Lamp Test (0 = on) 
     1 INPUT : Clear Memory (0 = on)      2 OUTPUT : Unused      3 OUTPUT : A square wave of 4 Hz is generated to hold a wa tchdog 
timer in a triggered but not time-out state. The timer is used to reset 
the processor should it ever hang. This square-wave output shal l be 
generated only if the processor is executing the program correc tly.  
Once the processor hangs, this output shall stop, causing the 
watchdog to reset the processor upon time-out. The resetting 
process shall not cause any alteration of memory data already 
present. 
   In order to prevent corrupted memory data from being taken as  correct, a suitable means shall 
be employed to constantly verify the data in memory and to turn  on the "MEMORY ERROR" LED 
once the data is found to be invalid.  A suitable means shall a lso be employed to ensure that the 
input data read is valid, thus preventing any spuring data from  being used. 
 
  On the logic board, two push buttons, "CLEAR" and "LAMP TEST" , shall be provided.  The 
"LAMP TEST" pushbutton shall cause all processor-controlled LED  to turn on when pressed. 
Normal indication shall resume when the button is released.  Wh en the "CLEAR" pushbutton is 
pressed momentarily, all timers above 5-sec duration are caused  to time-out. This is to assist in 
testing and trouble-shooting. When the "CLEAR" pushbutton is he ld down for 2 secs, all the 
"Memory" fault conditions are cleared, including the "MEMORY ER ROR" condition. 
  (b) The Indicator Board 
   There shall be a green LED, indicating "SYSTEM POWER ON" whic h is to be directly controlled 
by the 5-V DC power supply, three yellow LED, indicating the bi nary "FAULT LEVEL CODE", a 
green LED, indicating the "PRESENCE OF REPAIR TECHNICIAN", and a red LED, indicating 
"MEMORY ERROR". 
   There shall also be two red LED for each fault.  One of them shall be controlled directly or 
indirectly by the source and the other solely by the processor.   Both LED shall be energized on 
the occurrence of their corresponding fault.  However, once the  fault has been rectified, the 
source LED shall be de-energized whilst the processor-controlle d LED shall remain energized 
until the memory is cleared manually. 
 
  "SUCTION TANK OVERFLOW" indication must be delayed for 2 seco nds. This is to prevent 
false and/or intermittent indication. 
 
  "SUCTION TANK LOW LEVEL" indication shall be delayed for the number of minutes set by the 
"TIMER" DIP switches.  The range of this 4-bit timer shall be 0  to 15 minutes. 
 
  "DUTY PUMP FAILURE" indication shall be on only when the logi c condition (Duty Pump Failure 
Input AND Time Switch Control AND NOT Suction Tank Low Level AN D NOT Starter 1 AND 
NOT Starter 2) is positive.  The Suction Tank Low Level conditi on shall be taken after the preset 
delay. 
 
  If no other fault condition is present, the "EMERGENCY AND AL ARM START" condition shall be 
reset when the repair technician is present and for 1 hour afte r his departure regardless of its 
input status.  Should another fault come on the indication shal l revert to normal.  This forced 
reset shall be cancelled 1 hour after the technician's departur e. 
 
  Clear labelling of the faults for each LED shall also be prov ided on the board.

sited so that at least two thirds of the effective capacity of the suction tank is above the level of 
the centre of pump suction.  Where this is not possible, provid e separate priming tanks with foot 
valves for each pump. 
   Submit to the SO Rep for approval the characteristic performa nce curves of the pumps offered. 
The efficiency of the pumpset shall not be less than 50% at the  operating conditions.

   The sequence of operation of the hose reel pumps shall be as follows :  
 
  (i) The duty pumpset shall automatically come into operation when a pressure switch located 
in the branch out pipe feeding the two pressure tanks detects a  fall of normal static 
pressure in the pipe below a predetermined value. 
 
  (ii) If the duty pump fails to start or the demand for water exceeds the nominal output of the 
duty pump (ie. when three or more hose reels operate simultaneo usly), this drop in 
pressure shall be sensed by another pressure switch located adj acent to the first pressure 
switch, which shall then start the standby pump.  The exact cut -in pressure of the standby 
pump shall be varied according to the normal system pressure an d the performance curve 
of the pump. 
 
  (iii) As the requirements for water reduces, the pressure in the system increases.  When there 
is no demand to the system and the normal static pressure has b een established, this 
preset pressure shall be sensed by both pressure switches and t he duty and standby 
pump shall be switched off respectively. 
 
  After each start/stop pumping cycle, the duty pump shall be a lternated automatically by 
the use of an auto changeover relay to avoid one pump remaining  stationary for long 
period. Provide a manual selector switch to select the duty or standby pump. Emergency 
power supply shall be connected to the pumps where available.

62.9 TESTING CRITERIA FOR THE OPTICAL FIBRE CABLE 
   To ensure that the optical fibre cable to the unit is in good working condition upon completion of 
installation works, both of the following methods of testing mu st be carried out: 
  (a) Continuity Testing – This involves checking that the optic a l  f i b r e  c a b l e  i s  n o t  p h y s i c a l l y  
 broken at any point, and that the optical fibre cable does ind eed go from one location to the 
 correct destination using a powerful visible red laser; and  
 
 (b) Scanning at the fibre interface/ termination point with an  Optical Time Domain Reflectometer 
 (OTDR)  – An OTDR is capable of measuring the fibre lengths, l osses, connector losses, splice 
 losses and fibre defects, and works by sending a pulse of ligh t into the fibre and measuring how 
 much light is reflected back and detected at the OTDR. It will  produce a line or graph on a screen 
 and by measuring how much light is reflected, the OTDR can det ermine the loss associated with

BLDG21/S63.DOCX(2) 
Sal(151220) 
(DPG) 63.2 SYSTEM OF OPERATIONS  (CONT’D) 
 
63.2.2 Alarm Operation 
 
 The operation of one or more trigger devices shall result in a n immediate fire alarm given by : 
 
 (a) an audible/visual alarm from all the alarm bells/strobe li ghts situated in the entire building; 
 
 (b) a visible indication for each zone in which a trigger devi ce operates. 
 
 Where a number of alarm signals are received in quick successi on, or simultaneously, the Plant and 
equipment shall be designed so that a general audible alarm con tinues or resounds as each visible 
indication commences. 
 
 The alarm state shall be maintained by the main alarm panel wi thout a continued signal from the trigger 
device so that even destruction of a connection after the trigg er device operates shall not discontinue 
the sounding of the alarm. 
 
 
63.2.3 Alarm Silencing Switch 
  The audible and visual alarms shall continue until silenced by  the manual operation of a silencing switch; 
they shall not be automatically silenced.  The design of the si lencing switch shall be such that the audible 
alarm can only be silenced after 3 minutes of sounding.  The pr inciple of design shall be such that no 
other control is able to override the silencing switch during t he 3 minutes of sounding. 
 
 The operation of a silencing switch while an alarm condition e xists shall not cancel the visual indication 
of the fire alarm nor shall the operation of the silencing swit ch prevent the proper receipt of alarms from 
any zone(s) not yet providing an alarm signal.  Further, its op eration shall not prevent the transmission 
of the alarm signal to the monitoring station. 
 
 There shall be only one switch for the silencing of the audibl e and visual fire alarm.  In addition, the 
operation of the audible and visual fire alarm re-sounding syst em shall not require the activation of any 
other manual switches and devices. 
 
 The restoration of the silencing switch to its normal position  whilst an alarm condition exists shall transfer 
the alarm to the fire alarm bells. 
  
63.2.4 Fault Warning 
 
 The fire alarm system shall be capable of detecting fault auto matically whenever it develops in any of 
the circuits and a fault warning shall be given by both an audi ble warning from a buzzer and a visible 
indication in the main alarm panel.  This buzzer in the main al arm panel shall be distinctive and of a 
different character from fire alarm bells. 
 
 The buzzer warning shall be cancelled by a single silencing sw itch solely designed for this purpose and 
unless the fault is rectified, the visual indication shall pers ist.  The removal of a fault shall automatically 
reset the audible fault warning circuit.  The occurrence of ano ther further fault while the buzzer is 
silenced shall cause the buzzer to sound again.  Similarly, the  restoration of the silencing switch to its 
normal position whilst a fault exists shall transfer the fault back to the audible fault warning of the system. 
  Any fault warning shall not prevent a fire alarm being given a t the same time.  At any time, an alarm of 
fire shall take priority over any other indication such as faul t warning. 
 
 A distinct visible and audible fault signal shall be given on the main alarm panel in the event of any of 
the following situations : 
 
 (a) failure or disconnection of the normal power supply to the  main alarm panels; 
 
 (b) failure such as low/high voltage or disconnection of the s tandby battery; 
  (c) failure such as low/high voltage or disconnection of the b attery charger; 
 
 (d) triggering circuit faults such as open circuit, short circ uit, earth fault of the +ve or -ve line in the 
wiring between trigger devices and the main alarm  panel includ ing the removal of any trigger 
devices;

between alarm bells and the main alarm panel including the remo val of any bells; 
 
 (f) open circuit in any of the looping circuits that control t he networking of general alarm, silencing 
and reset function; 
 
 (g) rupture or disconnection of any fuse or the operation of a ny protective devices that would prevent 
a fire alarm being given. 
  Should any of the above situations from (i) to (vii) (inclusiv e) occur in the respective sub-alarm panels 
a distinct visible signal shall also be given on the main alarm  panel.

 INTERFACE CONTROL DOCUMENT  
1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this Interface Control Document (ICD) is to defi ne the interface scope, data parameters 
and demarcation between the Smart Hub and Smart Systems to be i ngested. It documents and tracks 
the necessary information required to effectively define the Sm art Hub system’s interface as well as any 
rules for communicating with it.  
1.2 Scope 
This document covers all the interface requirements between the  Smart Hub and Smart Systems. This 
ICD helps to ensure compatibility between system segments and c omponents by clearly communicating 
all possible inputs and outputs between the components. 
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations 
The Interface Control Document uses a few special terms like ev ent and alarms. Events are operator 
actions, informational messages, tracking/auditing messages and  statistical readings. When Smart Hub 
receives these events, it processes them based on the rules set  and the event becomes an alarm if the 
event follows the rule.

 2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW 
This ICD describes the relationship between the Smart Systems a nd Smart Hub on data ingestion 
aspects. 
This ICD specifies the interface requirements the participating  systems must meet. It describes the 
concept of operations for the interface, defines the message st ructure and protocols that govern the 
interchange of data, and identifies the communication paths alo ng which the project team expects data 
to flow. 
For each interface, the ICD provides the following information:  
 A description of the data exchange format and protocol for exc hange 
 A general description of the interface 
 Assumptions where appropriate 
 Estimated size and frequency of data exchange 
 Mandatory Security Standard 
 
2.1 Classification of Smart Hub Interfaces 
 
Type Data Ingestion 
MQTT Yes 
 
2.2 Smart Hub Architecture on Sensor Integration 
The Smart Hub platform gathers and analyses data for the variou s sectors and industry players critical 
to the realization of a Smart Nation, to achieve the following benefits: 
 
 Timely collection of data from various incumbent and new syste ms to enable automated 
analytics and early detection of events of interest 
 
 Situational awareness enabling quick responses to current oper ational processes, threatening 
events, emergencies, equipment/sensors alerts and other situati ons of interest 
 
 Distribution of alerts and notifications through email and SMS . 
 
 Intelligent, insightful information & prediction through data & predictive analytics for proactive 
day-to-day city operations as well as supporting long term plan ning 
 
2.3 Modes of Data Transmission  
 
Systems would transmit data through three modes: 

Page 934:
 
APPENDIX A51 
Page 3  
BLDG21/A50.DOCX(3) Sal(151220) (DPG)
 Mode Description 
1 Sensors are first connected to a vendor system/server, which would then send data to Smart Hub.  
2 Sensors send data to vendor system/servers and Smart Hub simu ltaneously through two separate 
data links.  
3 Sensors only send data only to Smart Hub.  
 
2.4 The Contractor and his Specialist(s) shall adopt the follow ing connectivity modes for the Systems: 
Smart System Mode 
Smart Water Pump 2 
Smart Water Sub-meter 3 
Power Consumption and Fault Detection Monitoring System (PCFDMS ) 2

 3 INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS 
3.1 Interface Overview 
Smart Hub provides MQTT as the interface method for data ingest ion.   
 Smart Hub sensor integration using MQTT protocol are divided i nto few steps: 
a) Framework design (Data Dictionary, Event & Alarm Design) 
b) Asset loading (Masterdata) 
c) System configurations for alarms (Smart Hub admin task)  d) Client cert generation 
e) Sending live sensor data over MQTT protocol 
 
3.2 Protocol Allocation based on the sensor type 
All Smart Systems shall use MQTT interface to transmit data to Smart Hub.  
 
3.3 Sensor Integration using MQTT protocol in detail  
MQTT protocol specification details are available in  
http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.h tml 
 
Payload format is json with some mandatory key value pairs. 
 Sample payload: 
 
{ 
    "SenderId": "Waterpump-600209-TransferPump", 
    "SensorId": "PUMP-ADEMCO-600209-TransferPumpRm-Pump-1", 
    "Resourcepath": 600209, 
    "EventId": "EV-600209-WP-20160822104950234", 
    "EventType": "Waterpump/system#reading", 
    "Parameters": { 
     "sensorstatus": "online",

3.3.1 Mandatory Field Definition for Events 
 
Field Name Description Sample Value Length in 
Byte 
SenderId SenderID refers to the sender of the data. Depending on the 
design of the Smart System, this could be the aggregation 
point of the data, location of  the System, or the sensor 
itself. 
<SensorType>‐<PostalCode>‐<AggregatorIdentifier> 
Sensor Type must be alphabets w ithout special characters;  
Instead of Postal code, location  code can be used if there is 
no postal code available for the location. Eg. JE‐OUTDOOR 
 Refer to table in 
Appendix III 255 
SensorId <SensorType>-<Vendor>-<PostalCode>-
<GenericIdentifier> 
Vendor name must be alphanumeric without special 
characters;  
Instead of Postal code, location code can be used if 
there is no postal code available for the location. E.g. 
JE-OUTDOOR 
A generic Identifier is used so that even when the 
specific sensor is replaced by new hardware, Smart 
Hub recognises it as the same sensor point. Refer to table in 
Appendix III 255 
Resourcepath Resource path is the postal code of the block or the 
location code. This values should be same as the 
postal code used in the master data while loading 
sensor details. If postal code is not available for some sensors, then location code can be used. E.g. JE-
OUTDOOR 600226 255 
EventId Reference/transaction Id. Used to group few events 
together. 
EV-<PostalCode>-<SerialNo>-<Timestamp> EV-600216-

Severity 1 Critical A situation where the System 
is unable to operate (e.g. 
bincenterfault) 
2 Major Where there is a fault in some 
of the important equipment but 
it does not affect the entire operation of the System. 
3 Minor Minor equipment fault. 
4 Info It may not be an alarm but the 
user may be interested to 
know.  
5 Clear When fault is cleared. 
6 Reading While updating the system 
status. 
 
Events such as Solar/inverter#Reading, 
WaterSM/meter#Reading, etc are for the updating of 
System status and hence the severity for such cases is ‘Reading’. For the faults, severity depends on the type of the fault. e.g. 3   255 
Parameters All the sensor related fields are to be enclosed in the 
parameters. It supports only two data types --  String 
and Number. String values are enclosed in double quotation marks, whereas numbers are not enclosed in 
quotation marks. {"valve_status":"value"
,"valve_chute_level":"n
ormal"}  Key:255 
Value:255

 3.3.1 Mandatory Field Definition for Events (Cont’d) 
 
Parameters 
Parameters are the property used to indicate the dynamic values  of the sensors. Since each of the 
sensors has a different set of functionalities, which are dynam ic in nature, the current design will allow 
many different types of combinations of parameters to be sent t o Smart Hub. Unit of measurement can 
also be used along with parameter names for e.g.  
AC_voltage (V) or {“AC_current (A)”:3.0} 
 
Event Type 
Event type is used to describe what type of event it belongs to . It is used to visualize event on the 
operator’s console.  
The strategy for creating the event types are:  
Event Type = <Type of Sensor> / <sub-type> #<event type> 
E.g.:  Solar/inverter#reading,  
Electrical/sub-meter#commsFault, 
Water/sub-meter#reading  
Where #reading are status updates or heart beat events. 
The frequency of the heart beat / status update is defined acco rding to the sensor type. 
 
3.3.2 Mandatory field definition for alarms on top of events fi elds 
 
Faultcode Specifies type of fault as defined in the System spec ific dictionary String 
Description Description or note of the fault/incident String 
 
Faults in the Smart Systems shall be identified and assigned se verity values based on the priority of the 
fault. For example, if a certain event type is identified as an  alarm, the alarm can be configured in the 
Smart Hub system configuration page (hdb->cep_config->severity. events) to get this event to appear as 
an alarm. Thereafter, the Smart Hub system will detect the alar ms based on the severity and alarm 
types configured. These additional fields help to visualize the  details of the alarm. 
In order to clear a fault, the sensor system has to send anothe r event to clear the previous fault 
generated in the same system.  
 
RefEventId Specifies the previous fault event id  String 
RefEventType Specifies the previous fault event type String

 3.3.3 Security Requirements 
MQTT Broker supports only TLS 1.2 protocol. 
Supported cipher suits are: 
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, 
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, 
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, 
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256, 
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384, 
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 
 
The SSL client certificates will be issued to each of the vendo r, and the sensor has to use this certificate 
to authenticate itself to the broker. 
 
3.3.4 MQTT Structure and Protocol settings 
Broker URL is: 
Production: ssl://192.168.8.35:9884 
UAT: ssl://192.168.8.38:9884 
 
Topic name will be based on the sensor type. Format for topic is VirtualTopic/mqtt/<sensor type>/incoming 
Proposed Quality of Services setting,  
Qos 2: Exactly once delivery 
 
This is the highest quality of service, for use when neither lo ss nor duplication of messages are 
acceptable. There is an increased overhead associated with this  quality of service. 
A QoS 2 message has a Packet Identifier in its variable header.  The receiver of a QoS 2 PUBLISH 
Packet acknowledges receipt with a two-step acknowledgement pro cess. 
 
Keep live timeout for message is 60 seconds for MQTT broker to retain the established session. 
Heartbeat rate frequency for every sensor is 15 minutes, i.e. I n order for the sensor to appear as online 
in Smart Hub, they sensor must send an event message every 15 m inutes.  
 
3.3.5 Testing using MQTTfx 
MQTTfx is a GUI testing tool, which helps to generate mqtt mess ages and send to the Smart Hub for 
testing. 
Download MQTTfx from http://www.jensd.de/apps/mqttfx/1.7.0

 4 INTERFACE DEFINITIONS IN DETAIL 
The following section describes the interface definition for ea ch sensor type in detail. In general: 
The measurements readings and status changes are Events. Faults and abnormal conditions are Alarms. The alarm is trigger ed based on the rules set in 
Smart Hub. One of the rules set is that the Smart Hub will trig ger an alarm based on the 
severity of an event.  
e.g. If severity < 4, an event turns to alarm.

 5 POINTS TO BE NOTED 
 SensorId should be unique, as elaborated in Appendix III. 
 If the sensor does not follow the ICD specifications, the Smar t Hub will not show sensor 
readings or alarms. 
 Prior to send sensor data, sensorIds must be added into master  data and loaded in the Smart 
Hub system. 
 Sensors must filter out the duplicate records in the flat file s and empty readings. 
 Records in a file must be sequential with respect to the time.

APPENDIX A51

 6 MASTER DATA CONFIGURATION 
6.1 The Smart Hub system requires the master device list and ba sic properties of the each of the devices to 
be configured and linked to each device object. This is a one-o ff action. The data is populated in 
accordance to the physical device hierarchical relation. 
The system is designed to take in large numbers of sensors prop erties without the upfront definition of 
individual sensor.  As per the design, the properties of specif ic sensor can be represented as key value 
pair in static and dynamic parameters column of the master data . Hence any properties can be added to 
static properties. 
 
The inputs in this excel will fall under: 
1) Smart Hub specific – mandatory attributes required for Smart  Hub integration 
2) Sensor specific – attributes specific to the sensor 
 
The Master Data establishes an identity for sensor/device and t racks metadata such as device's 
attributes, capabilities, geo info, resource path, and so on. T his consistently formatted unique id would 
be a primary key which can be used as reference in event data o r any data set.

BLDG21/A50.DOCX(21) Sal(151220) (DPG)
 6.2 Sensor Details for Smart Hub 
The format below is an example. A detailed spreadsheet will be provided to the sensor vendor to 
populate. 
 
Table 6-1: Master Data File definition 
Smart Hub specific: 
Property Description Sample Value 
SensorId <SensorType>-<Vendor>-
<PostalCode>-<GenericIdentifier> 
Vendor name must be alphanumeric 
without special characters;  
Instead of Postal code, location 
code can be used if there is no 
postal code available for the location. E.g. JE-OUTDOOR 
A generic Identifier is used so that 
even when the specific sensor is 
replaced by new hardware, Smart Hub recognises it as the same 
sensor point. See Appendix III 
 
Sensor Type Sensor type Smart Pump 
Sensor Display Name Name to be displayed in Smart 
Hub’s real time monitoring software 
GUI See Appendix III 
Postal Code Postal code, if the postcode is not 
available just add some unique 
code eg: 99990001 600321 
X x/Easting 34.345234 
Y y/Northing 64.345454 
Z z/height 22.22 
Location Descriptor To display the location name in the 
smart hub system. See Appendix III 
Sensor Manufacturing 
Company Brand/Vendor Ademco  
Sensor Model Model MHW33 
Sensor specific: 
Additional attributes will be required according to the sensor type. They are required for Smart Hub as 
well as for compliance with WOG sensor attribute conventions.  
The sample values in the parameters/static properties column ar e for illustration purpose and they may 
not be real values of the sensors. The purpose of the static pr operties list to add static properties like 
Software Version, and compass bearing, etc.  
In the master data, the attribute names (headers) should includ e the units.   
For e.g. grid_frequency (Hz).

 6.3 Master Data Considerations 
1. X, Y and Z coordinates shall be provided in svy21 reference system. 
2. Any specific parameter with respect to sensor type can be ad ded as key value pair, if you don’t 
have any value at the moment just put it as N.A (Not applicable )
